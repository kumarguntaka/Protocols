Welcome to the Protocols repository! This repository serves as a hub for multiple projects based on communication protocols in my profile, each organized as a submodule. The projects are primarily focused on digital, mixed signal and analog communication channels, using various simulation tools to develop, verify and validate.

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new projects or improvements to existing ones, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
